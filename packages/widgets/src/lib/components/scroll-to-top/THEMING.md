# ScrollToTopButton - Theming

To simplify custom styles on the component we used the built-in solution for component theming using [style-props].

The two component properties `styles` and `theme` are the ones allowing you to customize the component appearence.

- `styles` is a JS object with the CSS variable name to override (without `--` prefix) as key and the value set to the allowed one for that CSS variable. This approach helps when you wish to tune few styles for the component.
- `class`: is a global CSS class name where the class content has the CSS variables to override. Using `class` is more suitable when the goal is to create personal versions(themes) for the component, so sevaral props are override;

> Refer to the [Design Rules] document to better understand how the component has been designed and how to customize the styles.

## CSS Variables

The CSS variables are defined in the [variables.css](./variables.css) file.
